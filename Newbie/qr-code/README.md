# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Thanks for watching my challenge!

This front-end coding challenge is from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges, that helps and improves the coding skills by building realistic projects.

**The challenge is a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, with only the desktop version (full screen). It can be updated.**

## The challenge

My challenge is to build out this QR code component and get it looking like my own style rather the original design.
